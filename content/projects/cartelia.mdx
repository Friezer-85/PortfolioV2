**Cartélia** was a scholar project, in 2024, to explore entrepreneurship fundamentals, created with my friends and colleagues.

Our product was a card holder in genuine leather, locally made. All the benefits were given to a local non-profit.

I was in charge of many things, especially the **website** and communication supports (IG & FB / leaflets / advertising).

I was too the **technician** of the company, I managed POS system, and (pre)orders.
