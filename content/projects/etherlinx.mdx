**Cartélia** was a scholar project, in 2024, to learn entrepreneurship fundamentals, created with my friends and *colleagues*.

Our product was a card holder in real leather, made locally, and all the benefits were given to a local association.

I realized many things, especially the **website** and communication supports, for Instagram and Facebook.

I was also the **technician** of the corporation, i managed the POS system and the orders, and everyone loved my work !
